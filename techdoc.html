              <p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.) Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.</p>
              <p>To begin with, make a local copy of our oojs.html file. This contains very little — an element for us to write our source code into. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object syntax. While working with this example you should have your developer tools JavaScript console open and ready to type in some commands.</p>
              <p>As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable. Try entering the following below the JavaScript code that's already in your file, then saving and refreshing:</p>
              <code>var person = {};</code>
              <p>If you enter person into your JS console and press the button, you should get the following result:</p>
              <code>[object Object]</code>
              <p>Congratulations, you've just created your first object. Job done! But this is an empty object, so we can't really do much with it. Let's update our object to look like this:</p>
              <code>var person = {
    name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
    age: 32,
    gender: 'male',
    interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
    bio: function() {
      alert(this.name[0] + ' ' + this.name[1] + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. He likes ' + this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.');
    },
    greeting: function() {
      alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');
    }
  };</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Dot_notation">
          <header>Dot notation</header>
            <article>
              <p>Above, you accessed the object's properties and methods using dot notation. The object name (person) acts as the namespace — it must be entered first to access anything encapsulated inside the object.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>dot notation</li>
                  <li>namespace</li>
                  <li>encapsulated</li>
                  <li>array</li>
                  <li>member</li>
                </ul>
               <p>Next you write a dot, then the item you want to access — this can be the name of a simple property, an item of an array property, or a call to one of the object's methods, for example:</p>
              <code>person.age
  person.interests[1]
  person.bio()</code>
              <p>It is even possible to make the value of an object member another object. For example, try changing the name member from</p>
              <code>name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],</code>
              <p>to</p>
              <code>name : {
    first: 'Bob',
    last: 'Smith'
  },</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Bracket_notation">
          <header>Bracket notation</header>
            <article>
              <p>There is another way to access object properties — using bracket notation. Instead of using these:</p>
              <code>person.age
                person.name.first</code>
              <p>You can use</p>
              <code>person['age']
                person['name']['first']</code>
                <p>This looks very similar to how you access the items in an array, and it is basically the same thing — instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value. It is no wonder that objects are sometimes called associative arrays — they map strings to values in the same way that arrays map numbers to values.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Setting_object_members">
          <header>Setting object members</header>
            <article>
              <p>So far we've only looked at retrieving (or getting) object members — you can also set (update) the value of object members by simply declaring the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation), like this:</p>
              <code>person.age = 45;
                person['name']['last'] = 'Cratchit';</code>
              <p>Try entering the above lines, and then getting the members again to see how they've changed, like so:</p>
              <code>person.age
                person['name']['last']</code>
            </article>

              <p>Congratulations, you've reached the end of our first JS objects article — you should now have a good idea of how to work with objects in JavaScript — including creating your own simple objects. You should also appreciate that objects are very useful as structures for storing related data and functionality — if you tried to keep track of all the properties and methods in our person object as separate variables and functions, it would be inefficient and frustrating, and we'd run the risk of clashing with other variables and functions that have the same names. Objects let us keep the information safely locked away in their own package, out of harm's way.</p>
              <p>In the next article we'll start to look at object-oriented programming (OOP) theory, and how such techniques can be used in JavaScript.</p>
